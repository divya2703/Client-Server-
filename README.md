# Client-Server-Architecture


Using socket programming API in C, I am trying to create a server capable of establishing connection with multiple clients and then implement
Stop-and-Wait based data link layer level logical channel between server and client to provide error detection functionality for the recieved 
message using Cyclic Redundancy Code.
This was done as a part of Computer Networks Lab assignment in semester 6 @ IIT Guwahati under CSE dept with 2 other team members.
